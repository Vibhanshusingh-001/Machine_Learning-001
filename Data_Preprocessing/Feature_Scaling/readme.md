**Definition:**
Feature scaling through **standardization**, also known as **Z-score normalization**, is a preprocessing technique used to transform numerical features so that they have:

* a **mean of 0**, and
* a **standard deviation of 1**.

Mathematically, for each feature ( x ):

This ensures that all features contribute equally to the model, preventing those with larger numerical ranges from dominating the learning process.

###  **Why It Matters**

Feature scaling is crucial for many machine learning algorithms because it affects how they interpret and compare feature values.

#### Algorithms Sensitive to Feature Scale

Some models **depend on distances or gradients**, which are directly influenced by the magnitude of feature values:

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** computes distances between points — unscaled data can make some features dominate.
* **Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, SVMs:** scaling improves gradient-based optimization and speeds up convergence.
* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** scaling ensures all features contribute equally to variance.

####  Algorithms *Not* Sensitive to Scale

**Tree-based models** (like Random Forests, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Decision Trees) are mostly unaffected by feature scaling because:

* They split based on thresholds, not distances.
* Scaling does not change the relative ordering of values.

###  Example Insight

If you train a **KNN model** on unscaled data, the feature with the largest numerical range will dominate the distance calculations — leading to biased predictions.
After **standardization**, all features are on the same scale, and the model’s decision boundaries change significantly, often resulting in better performance.
