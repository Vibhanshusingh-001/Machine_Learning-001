l1_ratio--0 → Pure L2 (ridge)

1 → Pure L1 (lasso)

0.5 → Equal mix of both




C --->Purpose: Inverse of regularization strength (λ = 1 / C)

Small C → stronger regularization (simpler model, may underfit)

Large C → weaker regularization (more complex model, may overfit)


max_iter = the maximum number of learning steps allowed

Convergence = the point where the model stops improving
