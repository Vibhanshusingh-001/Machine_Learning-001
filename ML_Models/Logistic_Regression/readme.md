Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification problems. Unlike linear regression which predicts continuous values it predicts the probability that an input belongs to a specific class. It is used for binary classification where the output can be one of two possible categories such as Yes/No, True/False or 0/1. It uses sigmoid function to convert inputs into a probability value between 0 and 1. In this article, we will see the basics of logistic regression and its core concepts.
